# MongoDB - ShoppingWorld

## üìù Project Overview

**ShoppingWorld** is an online shopping company headquartered in **South Australia**, using a **MySQL relational database**. As the business expands globally, the current system is facing **performance issues**, especially with enquiries related to **customers, suppliers, and shopping details**.

To address this, the company is exploring a **NoSQL solution**, particularly **MongoDB**, inspired by the success of its **sister company in the US**.

## üí° Key Objectives

- Improve performance for frequent customer and sales staff enquiries.
- Enable scalable solutions to meet the growing demand and data volume.
- Support distributed offices in various countries for localized support.
- Handle semi-structured or unstructured data, where transactions may vary in data fields.
- Maintain ACID compliance, along with availability and partition tolerance.
- Develop a MongoDB-based prototype as a pilot project before full implementation.

## 1.Data Structure Design

MongoDB schema designed for **flexibility**, **scalability**, and **performance**, using embedded documents to support global business growth.

## 2.Inserting Data

Use the **Mongosh shell** to create collections and insert sample data.

### Schema Validation on `customers` Collection

Although MongoDB is a flexible NoSQL database that allows schema-less design, **schema validation** is important for the following reasons:

- **Data Consistency**: Ensures documents follow a defined structure and contain required fields.
- **Error Prevention**: Reduces bugs caused by missing or incorrect data types.
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents invalid data from being inserted or updated.
- **Reliable Queries**: Helps developers write more predictable queries and aggregations.
- **Security**: Blocks untrusted users from injecting malformed or harmful data.

MongoDB uses **JSON Schema validation** to define rules for each collection (like required fields, data types, value ranges, etc.).
