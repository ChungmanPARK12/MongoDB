![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9f680b3-1913-4024-a805-5a8f09141c37)

## üìù Project Overview

**ShoppingWorld** is an online shopping company headquartered in **South Australia**, using a **MySQL relational database**. As the business expands globally, the current system is facing **performance issues**, especially with enquiries related to **customers, suppliers, and shopping details**.

To address this, the company is exploring a **NoSQL solution**, particularly **MongoDB**, inspired by the success of its **sister company in the US**.

## üí° Key Objectives

- Improve performance for frequent customer and sales staff enquiries.
- Enable scalable solutions to meet the growing demand and data volume.
- Support distributed offices in various countries for localized support.
- Handle semi-structured or unstructured data, where transactions may vary in data fields.
- Maintain ACID compliance, along with availability and partition tolerance.
- Develop a MongoDB-based prototype as a pilot project before full implementation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Mongo Shell (mongosh)** ‚Äì For running database commands and queries.
- **MongoDB Compass** ‚Äì For visualizing collections, documents, indexes, and schema validation.


## 1.Data Structure Design

MongoDB schema designed for **flexibility**, **scalability**, and **performance**, using embedded documents to support global business growth.

## 2.Inserting Data

Use the **Mongosh shell** to create collections and insert sample data.

### CRUD Operations on `customers` Collection

This section demonstrates Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using MongoDB shell commands.

### Schema Validation on `customers` Collection

Although MongoDB is a flexible NoSQL database that allows schema-less design, **schema validation** is important for the following reasons:

- **Data Consistency**: Ensures documents follow a defined structure and contain required fields.
- **Error Prevention**: Reduces bugs caused by missing or incorrect data types.
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents invalid data from being inserted or updated.
- **Reliable Queries**: Helps developers write more predictable queries and aggregations.
- **Security**: Blocks untrusted users from injecting malformed or harmful data.

MongoDB uses **JSON Schema validation** to define rules for each collection (like required fields, data types, value ranges, etc.).

## 3.Relation to Query Design, Indexing, and Sharding

- **‚úÖ Query Design**: `$lookup` is part of query design, used to join documents from two collections in a single query.
- **‚ö° Indexing**: To improve performance, indexes should be added on `customerID` in both `customers` and `shopping_Carts` collections.
- **üåê Sharding/Partitioning**: For large datasets, MongoDB sharding can distribute collections across shards, but `$lookup` can be expensive unless both collections are sharded on the **same key** (e.g., `customerID`).

### Aggregation with `$lookup`

Joins `customers` and `shopping_Carts` collections to show cart details for customer with `customerID: 2`.

### Indexing on `customers`

### Creating `ttlLogs` Collection with Schema Validation

The following command creates a `ttlLogs` collection with **schema validation** using `$jsonSchema`. It ensures that each log entry includes a `loggingDateTime`, `transactionType`, and `logMessage`.
 - Ensures **data integrity** by enforcing types and required fields.
 - Helps maintain a consistent structure in `ttlLogs`.
 - Prepares the collection for use with a **TTL index** (e.g., auto-delete logs after a certain time).

## 4.User Access Control

 Grants the user administrative privilegs across all database:
  - `userAdminAnyDatabase`: Create/manage users
  - `readWriteAnyDatabase`: Read/write access to all DBs
  - `dbAdminAnyDatabase`: Admin functions like index creation

## üìã Project Summary

This MongoDB project for **ShoppingWorld** demonstrates how a traditional relational system can be transformed into a flexible, scalable NoSQL solution. Key features include schema design, data insertion, aggregation queries, indexing, user authentication, and TTL log management ‚Äî all implemented using **Mongo Shell** and **MongoDB Compass**.

The prototype showcases how MongoDB can effectively support modern e-commerce platforms with dynamic data structures and high-performance query handling.
